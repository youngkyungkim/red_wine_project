# Telecom Project

I am going to make a model to predict behavior of customers whether they would be retained or not. This data had been provided by IBM for teaching and data contains information about Telco customers. This kind of data and analysis is important for service provider in deciding marketing strategy to retain their customers. If they know which customers are not likely to be retained, then they could prevent this from happening by giving better offer to those customers. This kind of actions will prevent profit loss. I was personal motivated to investigate this problem because this dataset and problem seemed to be something I will be doing in company as a data scientist.
